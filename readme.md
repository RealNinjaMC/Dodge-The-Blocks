# 🎮 Dodge The Blocks

**Dodge The Blocks** is a simple arcade-style game built with Python and Pygame.  
You control a blue player block at the bottom of the screen and try to survive as long as possible while red blocks fall from above.  
As time goes on, the game becomes faster and more challenging.

This project was created mainly for learning game development basics and practicing clean code organization using multiple Python files.
